# hand_eye_adjoint

This is a MATLAB package for adjoint transformation algorithm (ATA) for monocular/stereo hand-eye calibration. The usage of this package is straightforward. The package contains hand-eye calibration codes from these papers [1]-[4] and ATA as well as the code that we use to do the analysis with synthetic data.
